# Edge-Orientation Classification using Spiking Neural Network and Neuromorphic Tactile Sensor

A long-term goal in soft robotics and the medical field is to develop artificial tactile sensing
abilities that mimics the human touch. In this project, the classification of the edge orientation using
neuromorphic tactile sensor and Spiking Neural Network was investigated. The sensor used here is
the NeuroTac sensor which integrates event-based vision system (mini-eDVS). The Spiking Neural
Network was used to process the sensor tactile information output. The data set was the orientation
of an edge in 10-degree steps using the Leaky-Integrate-and-fire neural model. the model output
was then classified using various classifiers. The different metrics was used to evaluate the output,
have showed that the SVC classifier have an accuracy of 99.7 % after the classifier was optimized
using the hyperparameter optimization algorithm â€“ Hyperopt-sklearn.
